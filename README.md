Welcome to the template for the COSC2500 C assignment for Cloud 9.
You will find the screen split into three main windows:

  - File viewer and text editor (this window)
  - Terminal for compiling and running programs (bottom)
  - File browser (left)

For convenience a copy of the assignment PDF and the supplied
source file has been provided along with this readme document.

We are trialling using Cloud 9 this year for COSC2500.
We would appreciate any feedback you might have about your
experience using cloud 9, please send feedback to Isaac or Marcus.
